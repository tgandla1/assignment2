Follow Below Cooking Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you need to use oil, try cooking sprays or apply a small amount of oil with a pastry brush.</li>
<li>Cook in liquids (such as stock, wine, lemon juice, fruit juice, vinegar or water) instead of oil.</li>
<li>Use low-fat yoghurt, low-fat milk, evaporated skim milk or cornstarch instead of cream in sauces or soups.</li>
<li>When browning vegetables, put them in a hot pan then spray with oil, rather than adding the oil first to the pan.</li>
<li>An alternative to browning vegetables by pan-frying is to cook them first in the microwave, then crisp them under the grill for a minute or two.</li>
<li>Use pesto, salsas, chutneys and vinegars in place of sour creams, butter and creamy sauces.</li>
<li>When you make a stew or soup, refrigerate leftovers and skim off the fat with a spoon before reheating and serving.</li>
<li>Eat fish regularly. Try different ways of cooking such as baking, broiling, grilling and poaching to add variety.</li>
<li>Include plant foods as sources of protein, including soybeans, pinto beans, lentils and nuts.</li>
<li>Replace higher-fat cheeses with lower-fat options such as reduced-fat feta and part-skim mozzarella.</li>
<li>Select lean cuts of beef and pork, especially cuts with "loin" or "round" in their name.</li>
<li>Cut back on processed meats high in saturated fat, such as hot dogs, salami and bacon.</li>
<li>Bake, broil, roast, stew or stir-fry lean meats, fish or poultry.</li>
<li>Drain the fat off of cooked, ground meat.</li>
